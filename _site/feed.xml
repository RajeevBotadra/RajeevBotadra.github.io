<p>An article about uncontrolled wildfires in the Redwood forest sparked my interest in addressing this pressing environmental issue. I envisioned developing an autonomous UAV capable of surveying fire-prone areas identified by experts and reporting any suspicious activity.</p>

<p>Due to time constraints, the drone does not feature fully autonomous flight. Instead, it requires operator input but can navigate pre-planned paths and alert the operator to anomalies such as smoke, fire, or high winds.</p>
